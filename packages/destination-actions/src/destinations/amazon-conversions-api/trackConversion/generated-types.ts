This functionality enables advertisers to precisely monitor campaign effectiveness while maintaining customer data privacy, eliminating the need to share sensitive information like hashed email addresses or phone numbers with Amazon, particularly when analyzing complex customer journeys across multiple channels and devices. The advertisers who implement the Amazon Advertising Tag (AAT) on their websites can transmit match_id as a parameter in conjunction with online event tracking. The Amazon system subsequently correlates these identifiers with users through cookies or hashed Personally Identifiable Information (PII). In instances where users complete offline conversions, advertisers can report these activities through the Conversions API (CAPI) utilizing the corresponding match_id, ensuring seamless cross-channel attribution.
