# Browser Destinations

This package contains the implementations for browser destinations.

# Glossary

- Action: A method defined by the author of the destination that's linked to a Segment event.
- Plugin: A plugin is an action in AJS lingo. You can see the loaded plugins by typing `analytics.queue.plugins` in the browser's console.
- Subscription: A "way-in" into an action. For example: the `updateUser` action uses a subscription of the type `identify`. See the test section for more information.

## Developing

> NOTE: The shell commands mentioned below must be run with `browser-destinations` as root directory. Every command should be run using lerna.

### Actions CLI

See the [Actions CLI](https://github.com/segmentio/action-destinations#actions-cli) of the root directory of this repo to learn how to interact with the Actions CLI. Interacting with the actions CLI will allow you to create new destinations, actions and update your type definitions.

### Types

When udating the types inside of your actions remember to regenerate the types of your integration by running this command in the top level directory.

```
bin/run generate:types
```

### Manual testing

You can run a test webpage that makes every browser destination available for testing.
Steps include:

- 1. Run the web server

```
yarn dev
```

- 2. Visit the webserver: [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
- 3. Set up a subscription in the settings box. A minimum of one subscription is required to load your destination. A valid subscription and settings look like this:

```
{
  "client_code": "segmentexchangepartn",
  "admin_number": "10",
  "version": "2.8.0",
  "cookie_domain": "localhost",
  "mbox_name": "target-global-mbox",
  "subscriptions": [
    {
      "partnerAction": "upsertProfile",
      "name": "Upsert Profile",
      "enabled": true,
      "subscribe": "type = \"identify\"",
      "mapping": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

- 4. Select a destination from the picker and click `load`

Notes:

- Be careful of matching the name and type of the subscriptions. The parser is case sensitive and also "" vs '' sensitive.
- The `partnerAction` key must have an action that matches its value.

### Automated tests

Running the test suite

```
yarn test
```

Running one file at the time

```
yarn jest src/destinations/PATH-TO-YOUR-DESTINATION/__tests__/index.test.ts
```
