# PR request guidelines

- The pull request includes a description of testing performed.
- The pull request doesn't introduce a new required field to an already existing action definition. This will result in failures for existing customers.
- Ensure errors are handled as per [error-guidelines](../docs/error-handling.md).
- Ensure the pull request uses framework features such as [Conditionally required fields](https://github.com/segmentio/action-destinations?tab=readme-ov-file#required-fields)
- Check for grammatical and spelling mistakes in descriptions for Action Definition fields and Destination Definition settings.
