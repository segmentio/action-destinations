# Action Destinations

Action Destinations are a way to build streaming destinations on Segment. To begin, follow the instructions in Get Started below.

Fore more detailed instruction, see the following READMEs:

- [Create a Destination Action](./docs/create.md)
- [Troubleshooting](./docs/testing.md)

## Get started

### Local development

This is a monorepo with multiple packages leveraging [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) with [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces):

- `packages/ajv-human-errors` - a wrapper around [AJV](https://ajv.js.org/) errors to produce more friendly validation messages
- `packages/browser-destinations` - destination definitions that run on device via Analytics 2.0
- `packages/cli` - a set of command line tools for interacting with the repo
- `packages/core` - the core runtime engine for actions, including mapping-kit transforms
- `packages/destinations-actions` - destination definitions and their actions
- `packages/destinations-subscriptions` - validates events against an action's subscription AST

### Getting set up

You'll need to have some tools installed locally to build and test action destinations.

- Yarn 1.x
- Node 14.17 (latest LTS, we recommand using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node versions)

If you are a Segment employee you can directly `git clone` the repository locally. Otherwise you'll want to fork this repository for your organization to submit Pull Requests against the main Segment repository. Once you've got a fork, you can `git clone` that locally.

```sh
# Clone the repo locally
git clone <your fork or https://github.com/segmentio/action-destinations.git>
cd action-destinations

npm login
yarn login

# Requires node 14.17, optionally: nvm use 14.17
yarn --ignore-optional
yarn bootstrap

# Run unit tests to ensure things are working! All tests should pass :)
yarn test
```

### Actions CLI

In order to run the CLI (`./bin/run`), your current working directory needs to be the root of the `action-destinations` repository.

```sh
# see what's supported by the CLI
./bin/run --help

# scaffold a new destination
./bin/run init

# scaffold a new action within a destination
./bin/run generate:action <ACTION_NAME> <browser|server>

# generates TypeScript definitions for an integration
./bin/run generate:types

# start local development server
./bin/run serve
```

For specific information about each CLI command, please refer to this [README](https://github.com/segmentio/action-destinations/tree/main/packages/cli).

#### Troubleshooting CLI

If a CLI command fails to work properly, run the command with `DEBUG=*` at the beginning (e.g. `DEBUG=* ./bin/run serve`). This will produce a verbose debugging output, providing hints as to why something isn't working as expected. All of the CLI commands are also in the `./packages/cli/src/commands` directory if you need to inspect them further.

### Testing

Refer [here](./docs/testing.md) for more information about testing your destination actions.

### Configuring

Action destinations are configured using a single Destination setting (`subscriptions`) that should contain a JSON blob of all subscriptions for the destination. The format should look like this:

```js
[
  {
    "subscribe": "<fql query>",
    "partnerAction": "<actionSlug>",

    // See ./packages/core/src/mapping-kit/README.md for documentation. The keys in this object should match the `action.fields`
    "mapping": { ... }
  }
]
```

Here's a full example:

```json
[
  {
    "subscribe": "type = 'track'",
    "partnerAction": "postToChannel",
    "mapping": {
      "text": {
        "@template": "Tracked! event={{event}}, {{properties.text}}"
      },
      "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/0HL7TC62R/0T276CRHL/8WvI6gEiE9ZqD47kWqYbfIhZ",
      "channel": "test-channel"
    }
  },
  {
    "subscribe": "type = 'identify'",
    "partnerAction": "postToChannel",
    "mapping": {
      "text": {
        "@template": "User identified! email={{email}}"
      },
      "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/0HL7TC62R/0T276CRHL/8WvI6gEiE9ZqD47kWqYbfIhZ",
      "channel": "test-channel"
    }
  }
]
```
